            <p className="intro">While working as a TA for Software Design class, I had to manually check a lot of student submissions.
                Copying from QuickGrader was not accurate, and Canvas's submission download format was not the easiest to deal with.
                This project started with a python script, which took all submissions and sorted them into folders by student name.
                I took it a step further, and turned this script into an Electron Application for interactivity. 
                Next, I added Codellama AI for student code analysis. While this project only supports .gradle 
                build for now, I have already peaked interest of some of my friends to help me move it further.
